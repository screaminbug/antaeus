## Antaeus

Antaeus (/ænˈtiːəs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most "Software as a Service" (SaaS) companies, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database contains a few invoices for the different markets in which we operate. Your task is to build the logic that will schedule payment of those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions

Fork this repo with your solution. Ideally, we'd like to see your progression through commits, and don't forget to update the README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as small as you want.

## Brainstorming

#Currency
Each Customer has his/her own currency, which is probably the currency of their bank account, and payment processor may or may
not accept charging in foreign currency. With that and Since there is no constraint that invoice currency must match the customer currency,
a currency conversion provider must be made available to the billing service for currency conversion purposes before sending
it to the Payment Provider.

#Scheduling
Since requirement is to charge invoices on the first of the month, a some kind of scheduler will be needed.
A scheduled task will need to get all PENDING invoices and then call the Billing Service method pay with them.

#Possible pitfalls
Double charging. System must be made aware that invoice is being changed to prevent charging the customers multiple times.
This could happen if, for example, payment will be spread out over the course of day the day and is processed by multiple schedulers

Proposed solution. Add a new status of the invoice, for example PROCESSING which will prevent that from happening, since
only the PENDING statuses will be considered for sending to the billing service.

#Failure in billing service
A care needs to be taken so that charged invoices are marked as paid. If something goes wrong in the billing service
after the invoice has been successfully charged, there is a potential for invoices to get stuck in PROCESSING status.
Possible mitigations
1. If Billing record was succesfully persisted



PaymentProvider

## Developing

Requirements:
- \>= Java 11 environment

Open the project using your favorite text editor. If you are using IntelliJ, you can open the `build.gradle.kts` file and it is gonna setup the project in the IDE for you.

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker knowledge. We do recommend docker though.

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
docker build -t antaeus
docker run antaeus
```

### App Structure
The code given is structured as follows. Feel free however to modify the structure to fit your needs.
```
├── buildSrc
|  | gradle build scripts and project wide dependency declarations
|  └ src/main/kotlin/utils.kt 
|      Dependencies
|
├── pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
├── pleo-antaeus-core
|       This is probably where you will introduce most of your new code.
|       Pay attention to the PaymentProvider and BillingService class.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database 
|       models, mappings and access layer.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the Internal and API models used throughout the
|       application.
|
└── pleo-antaeus-rest
        Entry point for HTTP REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
```
